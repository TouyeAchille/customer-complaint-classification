The image depicts two key objects: a computer monitor on the left displaying a 2D schematic design of a jacket, and on the right, a physical blue-green hooded jacket displayed next to the monitor. The monitor showcases a design with bright green fabric and red stitching lines on a grid background, labeled 'Medium.' A measuring tape is draped over the hooded jacket, symbolizing tailoring or sizing. Below the monitor can be seen a keyboard. The jacket has a textured fabric, two vertical pockets, and a front zipper.
