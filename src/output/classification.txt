To classify the customer complaint based on the described image:

### **Category:** Product Quality

### **Subcategory:** Incorrect Design/Appearance  
This classification is applicable if the complaint revolves around the jacket's design not matching customer expectations, such as differences in pocket style, stitching, or accents (e.g., collar, cuffs, zipper details).

If the customer complaint entails a different issue, such as sizing, material problems, or defects, the subcategory might differ.
